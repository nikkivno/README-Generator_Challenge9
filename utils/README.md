# READ ME Generator (Bootcamp Challenge #9)

## Description
In this project I am exploring the functions and uses of Node.js by creating a form that is presented in the user's computer terminal with questions intended to fill in the blanks of a README.md file. This information is then put together using the inquirer npm and File System and is formatted into a professional README.md file.

## Installation <a id='installation'></a>
For a user to access this file, they need to open their terminal and direct themselves to the folder they have their code stored in. Once in the overarching file they can type in {node injex.js} and prompts will appear in the terminal for them to fill out. Once all information is collected they can go into their folder on VS code or wherever they wwork on code and see the generated README.md file. 

## Usage <a id='usage'></a>
The main use for this tool is to allow users to get a professional and cohesive README.md file EVERY time they do a project.All they have to do is essentially fill in the blanks. No more worrying about if you missed something important.
